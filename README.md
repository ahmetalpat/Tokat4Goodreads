Turkish Book Scraper For Goodreads

This script is for generating a file for books in Turkish by scanning their barcodes with a barcode scanner. The reason I write this script is that to upload my Turkish books to Goodreads. As it is known, there is a barcode scanner on Goodreads Mobile App, yet it does not recognize Turkish ISBN numbers.

Project is still in progress.
